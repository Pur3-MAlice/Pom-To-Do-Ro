Sprint 1 

- Agile perspective but with some waterfall techiniques. I wanted to ensure that the back end was functioning and able to perform the basics of what the app needed before moving on to the fron end react counterpart. Hence why some of the tasks, and sprints fall across many epics and stories. To fullfill one of these stories would need both the front and back end to be functioning together and correctly, but I couldn't build a house without first laying the foundations. So to combat any frustations, or premptives features and to stick to the MVP. Sprints were desgined first of all around the backend functionality, and then in the sense of completing user strorie and epics.
