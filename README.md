## Introduction

Pom-to-do-ro is a productivity application that combines the Pomodoro technique with a to-do list. This app aims to enhance time management and focus by integrating short work intervals (Pomodoros) with task tracking.

## Planning Phase

### App Overview

The app will include features such as:

- Pomodoro timer with customizable work and break durations.
- To-do list for managing tasks during work intervals.
- User authentication for personalized task tracking.

### Features

- Pomodoro timer with start, pause, and reset functionality.
- To-do list with add, edit, delete, and mark as complete features.
- User authentication for saving personal preferences and tasks.

### User Stories

1. As a user, I can start a Pomodoro session with a customizable timer.
2. As a user, I can add tasks to my to-do list.
3. As a user, I can edit and delete tasks.
4. As a user, I can mark tasks as complete.
5. As a user, I can customize Pomodoro session durations.

### Kanban Agile

Use GitHub Projects for Agile project management, organizing tasks into sprints and tracking progress.

### Research

Explore existing Pomodoro and to-do list apps to gather insights into design and functionality.

### Wireframes

Create wireframes for the app's UI, including the Pomodoro timer, to-do list, and user authentication screens.

### Database Schema

Define the data structure for storing user preferences and task data.

## Development

### Frontend

Develop the React frontend, incorporating components for the Pomodoro timer, to-do list, and user authentication.

### Backend

Build the Django Rest Framework (DRF) backend to handle user authentication and data storage.

### Connect Frontend to Backend

Establish communication between the frontend and backend, enabling data retrieval and updates.

### State Management

Implement state management in React for handling the app's state, including timer progress and task data.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Thoroughly test each feature, including the Pomodoro timer, to-do list CRUD operations, and user authentication.

### Bugs and Fixes

Document and address any bugs encountered during testing, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Deployment

### Final Deployment

Deploy the Pom-to-do-ro app to a hosting platform, providing instructions for setting up and running the application.
