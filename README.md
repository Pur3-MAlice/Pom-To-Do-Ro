Sprint 1 

- Agile perspective but with some waterfall techiniques. I wanted to ensure that the back end was functioning and able to perform the basics of what the app needed before moving on to the fron end react counterpart. Hence why some of the tasks, and sprints fall across many epics and stories. To fullfill one of these stories would need both the front and back end to be functioning together and correctly, but I couldn't build a house without first laying the foundations. So to combat any frustations, or premptives features and to stick to the MVP. Sprints were desgined first of all around the backend functionality, and then in the sense of completing user strorie and epics. In this sprint, one User story was completed "User Story 11 Implement user logout functionality -- As a user, I want to be able to log out of my account for security and privacy." Although the front end has not been built, logged in profiles now do have the FUNCTION to log out, even if there technically ins't an app to log out of yet.

Sprint 2 

- Whilst sprint 1 was focused on the user function and creating the ability to log in, log out and some authentication based on editsing there, (all backend fucntions, none front end). Spritn two was mainly compromised as the 'TASK SPRINT'. In this spirnt the function was to create the task app, build out the model and serialiser and made teh backend dajngo rest task views and creations. All of which happned, I also implemented the important/urgent booleans, as well as the user date time picker for the due_date. This sprint built the foundation of the User's ability to add tasks.
